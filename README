# You are free to coppy, distribute, modify, bla, bla, bla...(you know all that stuff)
#
# gDropboxCVS it's a simple script to use in combination with a Dropbox account to have 
# a minimalistic control version system for anyone with a Gnome Desktop. gDropbox it's perfect
# for individual projects or shared with only few people.
# 
# Use sample:
# Mike is a developer whom uses two computers and he would like to keep a project syncronized
# between both. He could use a dropbox folder directly but he doesn't want to upload each change,
# only when he is sure wants to push the changes to other computer. 
# 
# So, after working on his project, Mike launches gDropboxCVS and select "upload changes to dropbox"
# the software syncronizes development and dropbox folder (just modified files). Later, at home, Mike launches gDropboxCVS
# and selects "download changes".
#
# If Mike wants to restore some file he can just look for it in his dropbox folder and overwrite the modified.
# He some changes are pushed he could go to Dropbox webinterface and look up for the desired version 
# 


# INSTALL
# 0. gDropboxCVS needs zenity in order to work. 
#    To install zenity in ubuntu: $sudo apt-get install zenity
# 1. Be sure your Dropbox account is correctly configured.
# 2. Create a "cvs" folder under your Dropbox folder (you can choose other name).
# 3. (optional) Edit this file and specify your svn folder, local root folder and project nome
#    so you won't need to specify them each run.

# Hint: Put this script under cvs folder and you can use the same config in all computers
